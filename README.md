EU-VAT-Rates-for-Digital-Goods
==============================

A simple way to grab VAT rates for Digital Goods for all EU Member States in JSON format. Ideal for syncing with WooCommerce ;)

The rates are from http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf.

Member states can be identified through their ISO_3166-1 country code, and rates for both ebooks and other digital goods are included.
